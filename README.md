# Boilerplate for Ethereum Blockchain Developer

## Overview
This boilerplate contains all the setup to create, test and deploy *smart contracts* using [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/) and the initital structure to create the frontend using the 
framework Next.js. Truffle is not the only option available for *smart contracts* creation. You can use the online IDE [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) 
as well or the library [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/). To interact with the *blockchain* through JavaScript the choice was to go with the collection of libraries 
[*web3.js*](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.1/). Another possible choice would be to use the library [*ethers.js*](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/), as newer 
library that is growing in popularity. [This article](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/ethersjs-vs-web3js-sdk-comparison) makes a good comparison of both.
